# Menu_Management_Backend
PopMenu Manu Management Backend Project - Jacob Couvillon
Asssumptions and General Information:

- I completed the project using my Georgia Tech github account but transfered it to a regular account when I realized that people without a Georgia Tech account could not view my repository.

- Requirements section only describes creating an object model for the classes. I created an object model and tests in Java that met the requirements of Levels 1-3. I did not include anything else for the backend

- I included what I felt to be typical data associated with MenuItems, Menus, and Restaurants
